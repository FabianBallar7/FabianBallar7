### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a theoretical physicist mainly concerned with strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems. Currently pursuing a PhD in physics at the University of Augsburg, Germany. My main research interests live in the interface between quantum matter and quantum information and rely on leveraging computational methods to probe large scale quantum many-body systems.

I'm actively looking to collaborate on projects.
